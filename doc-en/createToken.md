## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1.  Do I need to open source the contract for token creation on Solana?
- Answer: No, it is not necessary. Tokens on Solana are created by using pre-established contracts provided by the official Solana team. All SPL20 tokens use the same contract.

### 2. Why is the wallet not displaying the logo?
- Answer: Sometimes, the information in the Phantom wallet may experience delays. Please be patient and wait for some time. You can also search for token information on the Solana browser.

### 3. Under what circumstances should permissions be discarded?
- Answer: In general, when adding a token to Raydium, you need to relinquish freeze and mint permissions. You can choose whether to relinquish metadata modification permissions. If you give up metadata permissions, the token's name and logo cannot be updated.

### 4. Is there a fee for uploading a logo?
- Answer: No, there is no fee. Our platform utilizes the IPFS storage solution, which is completely free of charge.
